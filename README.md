## 📌 Project Summary
A realistic case: predicting daily product sales for November 2025.  
This is fundamental for:
- Financial planning  
- Campaign and promotion design  
- Pricing strategy  
- Inventory optimization  
- Stockout prevention

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build an enriched dataset with temporal, calendar, and market variables.  
- Train an advanced ML model (XGBoost / HistGradientBoostingRegressor).  
- Deploy an interactive app to simulate discount scenarios.  
- Generate daily forecasts for November 2025, including Black Friday.

## 🛠️ Data Science Methodology
The project follows a professional DS/ML cycle:  
1. Problem definition → Sales forecasting  
2. Data collection & preparation → Historical sales, own & competitor prices, calendar events  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) → Visualization of patterns by day, category, subcategory, product  
4. Feature Engineering → Calendar variables, holidays, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, lags, moving averages  
5. Modeling → Training with XGBoost / HistGradientBoostingRegressor  
6. Evaluation → Metrics (MAE, MSE, RMSE)  
7. Implementation → Streamlit app for simulation and predictions

## 📊 Key Results
- Variables created: year, month, weekday, holidays, Black Friday, Cyber Monday, lags, moving averages, competitor price ratios.  
- Visualizations: sales by weekday, category, top products, temporal evolution with events.  
- Model trained: daily forecasting for November 2025.  
- Evaluation metrics: MAE, MSE, RMSE.
